# Moody's Speakeasy
This project showcases my design and frontend capabilities. I developed the application by creating a mood board, then a ux design, and then a prototype in Figma. Following that I built the Next.js app and deployed it to Vercel. The entire process took 2 days. The front end application features light and dark mode, CSS Transitions, and scroll animations. The app was built with NextJS, Typescript, React, and CSS3.
